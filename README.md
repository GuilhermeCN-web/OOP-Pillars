# ðŸ§© The 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository aims to explain the **4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in a simple and practical way: **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is OOP?
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code around **objects**, which represent real-world entities.  
Each object is composed of **attributes** (data) and **methods** (actions).

---

## âš¡ The 4 Pillars

### 1. Abstraction
**Abstraction** is the process of highlighting only the essential details of an object while hiding unnecessary information.  
ðŸ‘‰ Example: In a banking system, a `BankAccount` class may expose methods such as `deposit()` and `withdraw()`, without revealing the internal logic of fee calculation.

---

### 2. Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** protects an objectâ€™s data, allowing access only through specific methods.  
ðŸ‘‰ Example: Private attributes can only be modified through controlled methods, such as `setBalance()` and `getBalance()`.

---

### 3. Inheritance
**Inheritance** allows a class to reuse attributes and methods from another class.  
ðŸ‘‰ Example: A `Car` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class, reusing common features such as `accelerate()` and `brake()`.

---

### 4. Polymorphism
**Polymorphism** allows the same method to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.  
ðŸ‘‰ Example: The `speak()` method can have different implementations in the `Human` and `Dog` classes.
